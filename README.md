To record the learning and practice

## Gonna rebuild my blog
It is really a huge work, if I finished it, I'ill write a post to memorize it..

And together with a big fat gift reward for myself...

- [ ] Home Page Design
- [ ] Single page Design
- [ ] Add profile?
- [ ] Projects Add
- [ ] Posts re-organization
- [ ] Some new features ( such as comments, tags )
- [ ] to be continued

The structure of the website will break into four parts.
* Learning (real problem in work/ technology learning series/ notes taking)
* Algorithmns discussion (summary or analytic post for algorithmn used, could also link to the exercise sections)
* Projects (some quite cool front-end stuff)
* Exercises (leetcode/ code jam/code force)

Will use the design of (this template)[https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/]
