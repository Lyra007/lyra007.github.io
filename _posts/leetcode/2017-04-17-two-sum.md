[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### *Description:*

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.



### *Example:*

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

### *Some thoughts :*

What I thought initially is to calculate the sum of every two integers in this vector. And then store them and their indices in map. Using find method to find the target, and return the indices. To calculate the sum of two integers, we need to go through vector twice using two for loops. The complexity is o(n2).


One good idea discussed by others in leetcode is to go through vector only once. It is to check if the difference between target number and indices number is in the vector. Thus, we only need to go through the vector once. Below code will explain this well.
And the complexity is only o(n).

### *Accepted Solution:*

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
       map<int, int> set;
       map<int, int>::iterator it;
       vector<int> res;
       
       for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
           it=set.find(target-nums[i]);
           if(it!=set.end()){
               res.push_back(it->second);
               res.push_back(i);   
               return res;
           }else set[nums[i]]=i;
       }
    }
};
